    <p>Rita Kudrina</p>
    <p> For the past eight years, Rita have been working in the arts as a project manager and curator in Europe and the USA. She gained her education in Communication and Film Studies at the Vienna University which was pivotal for her future professional and personal development. It laid the foundations of her understanding of the Arts and Humanities and helped realize her professional direction. After she did an internship as a Public Art Commissions Assistant at the Contemporary Art Society in London, she was sure of her vocation. Ever since she kept working as a project manager and curator along with artists, film makers and scientists on projects that help the individual extend their awareness of the world we live in. Her passion for interdisciplinary projects has grown over the past years of practice.  Bringing art, science and technology together lies at the very heart of her work as a director at Art Related Foundation.</p>
