    <p class="indent">Art Related Foundation’s mission is to aid the discovery, creation and dissemination of new cultural forms and spaces by establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. We reach our goals by organizing interdisciplinary workshop programs, free exhibitions, educational programs, talks and events. Art Related collaborates with cultural institutions in Europe and beyond and supports the program of public and private institutions. The organization is developing and investing in cultural and educational projects that diversify the cultural landscape in Bulgaria by promoting transnational artistic exchange.</p>
    <p class="indent">In 2019, the foundation extended its network through partnerships with Wikimedia Deutschland, Creative Europe Desk – Bulgaria, Resonator – Hub for Creative Innovations and Sofia Art Week.</p>
